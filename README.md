### card.js

A Card & Deck class in JavaScript.

It can make a deck of cards from many decks joined together, and then shuffle them all.

It has some code tests at the end.

You can try it in a command prompt / terminal window with:

```
node card.js
```

or go to [repl.it's JavaScript online editor](https://repl.it/languages/javascript) and copy & paste it there.
